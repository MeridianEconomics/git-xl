Git XL is an open-source Git command line extension for managing Excel workbook files in Git.

The extension makes `git diff` work for Excel VBA (xls, xlt, xla, xlam, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, xltx, xltm). Git XL does not require Excel as it works directly on the workbook file.

With Git XL installed, Git can diff Excel VBA just like any other source code file.

It is written in Python, with pre-compiled binaries available for Windows.

Installation instructions and docs are available at [https://www.xltrail.com/git-xl](https://www.xltrail.com/git-xl).


## Getting Started 

### Installation
You can install the Git XL client on Windows, using the pre-compiled binary installer.

This repository can also be built-from-source using Python and PyInstaller.

Git XL requires a global installation once per-machine. This can be done by
running:

```
C:\Developer>git xl install
```

Alternatively, initialise Git XL locally (per repository), using the --local option, inside the root folder of your repositoryâ€™s local working copy:

```
C:\Developer>git xl install --local
```

### Usage

#### Diff workbooks

Get meaningful `git diff` output when comparing Excel workbook files containing VBA code.

```diff
C:\Developer>git diff dev..master
diff --xl a/Book1.xlsb b/Book1.xlsb
--- a/Book1.xlsb/VBA/Module/Module1
+++ b/Book1.xlsb/VBA/Module/Module1

 Option Explicit
 Public Function Version() As String
-   Version = "v1.0"
+   Version = "v1.1"
 End Function
```
